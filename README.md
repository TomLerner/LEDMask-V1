<h1>EDM LED Mask v.1</h1>

[![Demo Video]()](https://imgur.com/gsdOJ6r.jpg)


<h2>Intro</h2>

This is my first ever Arduino project showing how to create your own wearable LED Mask. The code is available in the repository as well as a "How To" guide with instructions on how I created my mask and all the necessary resources.

I'm currently working on a second mask (v.2) which has a different shape, will have a grided layout for the LEDs and will use the FastLED XYGrid as a starting base.
